# Changelog

All notable changes to Q-Wallets will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Transaction time tooltips now match the date shown in the row. Rows older than 24 hours display the date as `DD/MM/YY`, but the hover tooltip followed the browser locale, so an `en-US` browser showed the same transaction as `9/8/2026` — swapping the day and the month. Tooltips now use `DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss` on every wallet page.

### Tests

- Added tests for the new `epochToDateTime` helper, including one asserting it agrees with `epochToAgo` on day/month order.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- QORT addresses without a registered Qortal name can now be saved in the Address Book. The form explains that no name is registered, lets you type your own label, and no longer clears the address while you type it.
- Renaming an existing QORT contact whose address owns no registered name no longer wipes the address field.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Redesigned the wallet hub as a full visual and UX overhaul, replacing the older boxed layout with a cinematic coin-led workspace, atmospheric backgrounds, refreshed wallet tabs, and a cleaner right-side Address Book panel.
- Unified the QORT, BTC, LTC, DOGE, DGB, RVN, and ARRR wallet pages around the same shared workspace structure.
- Reworked send dialogs so transfers are easier to understand and harder to misread, with recipient-first layouts, cleaner amount fields, better Max/fee placement, clearer loading states while recipient data is being confirmed, and a smoother send-to-contact flow.
- Modernized the Address Book into a more usable wallet companion, with easier add/edit/delete flows, QORT name search when creating contacts, duplicate-contact warnings, explicit address confirmation before saving, softer row styling, lighter table text, pastel avatars, improved search styling, and better sync feedback.
- Refined transaction tables with lighter headers, improved pagination options, exact dates after 24 hours, smoother row hover feedback, and fewer layout jumps.
- Stabilized Receive QR layout inside Qortal Hub so the right rail can open naturally without making the background atmosphere shift.
- Reduced unnecessary automatic QORT balance refreshes from every 1 minute to every 2.5 minutes while keeping manual refresh available.

### Added

- Receive QR dialogs now work consistently for every wallet, not only QORT.
- QORT Address Book name search now marks results that are already saved with an "already in list" label.
- Save protection now warns users when they try to add a contact before confirming the address.
- Address Book sync now recognizes when local contacts are returned to the last synced state.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- `calculateMaxSendable` utility that computes the "SEND MAX" amount in integer satoshi math and holds back a small safety buffer, avoiding floating-point boundary errors that triggered false "Insufficient funds" rejections from the host
- `SEND_MAX_SAFETY_BUFFER_SATS` constant (1000 sats) used as the SEND MAX safety margin

### Fixed

- BTC and DGB Bech32 address validation: corrected the regex charset to the bech32 alphabet (excludes `1`, `b`, `i`, `o`) and allowed variable address length (39–59 chars) so longer Bech32 addresses (e.g. P2WSH) validate correctly
- SEND MAX no longer prefills an amount that lands on or just above the spendable cutoff

### Changed

- All coin send pages (ARRR, BTC, DGB, DOGE, LTC, QORT, RVN) refactored to use the shared `calculateMaxSendable` utility

### Tests

- Added tests for `calculateMaxSendable`
- Expanded address validation tests covering BTC/DGB Bech32 charset and length cases

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- QDN address book check: added `coinType` field to published QDN resources and dual validation in `fetchFromQDN` to discard resources returned by the Qortal node for a different coin identifier. Primary check uses the new top-level `coinType` field; secondary check uses entries' `coinType` field for backward compatibility with older published resources.
- TypeScript build errors for MUI v7 compatibility: replaced removed named exports (`SlideProps`, `TooltipProps`, `TransitionProps`, `SnackbarCloseReason`, `ToggleButtonGroupProps`) with `ComponentProps<typeof ...>` equivalents or local type definitions; added explicit `Theme` typing to `styled()` callbacks.
- `NumericFormat` forwarded MUI props no longer cause TypeScript errors.

### Tests

- Added 4 tests covering the QDN coinType mismatch scenario.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- QDN address book sync: skip unnecessary publish when timestamps diverge but content is identical (hash comparison before publishing)
- QDN address book sync: re-align local timestamp to QDN after skipping publish, and sync forward after publishing, to avoid redundant evaluations on next startup

### Changed

- Release workflow now fails with a clear message if the release version already exists, instead of silently deleting it
- Removed push trigger from npm tests workflow
